# Formalization and Correctness Proof of Incremental Merkle Tree Algorithm of Deposit Contract

Our formalization of the [incremental Merkle tree algorithm], especially the one employed in the [deposit contract], and its correctness proof w.r.t. the [original full-construction Merkle tree algorithm] can be found in [the final report](../deposit-contract-verification.pdf).

The correctness proof presented in the report has also been mechanized in K:
 * [deposit.k](deposit.k): Formal model of the incremental Merkle tree algorithm
 * [deposit-spec.k](deposit-spec.k): Correctness specifications
 * [deposit-symbolic.k](deposit-symbolic.k): Lemmas (trusted)

To run the mechanized proof:
```
$ make deps
$ make build
$ make test
```

Prerequisites:
 * Install K: https://github.com/kframework/k/releases
